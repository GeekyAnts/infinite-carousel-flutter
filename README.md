_Infinite Carousel_ is a flutter carousel widget that supports infinite looping and gives precise control over selected item anchor and carousel scroll velocity.

You can easily customize the placement of selected element on the viewport, and increase/decrease scroll speed.

Based on Flutter's ListWheelScrollView to create smooth scroll effects.

# Features

- Allows you to control placement of selected item on viewport (unlike pageview which always has its page in the center of viewport).
- Gives control over **velocity** of scrolling.
- Added **friction effect** to slow down the carousel after scrolling.
- Supports both horizontal and vertical axis.

# Usage

Add the package to `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  infinite_carousel: ^1.0.3
```

After that import the package.

```dart
import 'package:infinite_carousel/infinite_carousel.dart';
```

```dart
InfiniteCarousel.builder(
  itemCount: 10,
  itemExtent: 120,
  center: true,
  anchor: 0.0,
  velocityFactor: 0.2,
  onIndexChanged: (index) {},
  controller: controller,
  axisDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  loop: true,
  itemBuilder: (context, itemIndex, realIndex) {
  },
)
```

## Controller

It also supports its own scroll controller called _`InfiniteScrollController`_ which has number of useful methods to programmatically control the carousel.

- You can pass initialItem in the constructor.
- animateToItem(index)
- jumpToItem(index)
- nextItem()
- previousItem()

If axis is horizontal, then this corresponds to width of item, else height of the item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required                 |
| itemBuilder    | Widget Function(BuildContext, int itemIndex, int realIndex) | To lazily build items on the viewport. When Loop is false, ItemIndex is equal to RealIndex (i.e, index of element). When loop is true, two indexes are exposed by item builder. One is itemIndex, that is the modded item index i.e., for list of 10, position(11) = 1, and position(-1) = 9. Other is realIndex, that is the actual index, i.e. [..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...] in loop. Real Index is needed if you want to support JumpToItem by tapping on it. | Required                 |

## Flutter web

Earlier, flutter allowed scrolling the widgets by dragging using the mouse. Now, by default, it allows scrolling widgets to be dragged by all PointerDeviceKinds except for PointerDeviceKind.mouse.

If you want to support scrolling by drag, please pass the explicit `ScrollBehavior` to InfiniteCarousel.

```dart
scrollBehavior: ScrollConfiguration.of(context).copyWith(
  dragDevices: {
    // Allows to swipe in web browsers
    PointerDeviceKind.touch,
    PointerDeviceKind.mouse
  },
),
```
