_Infinite Carousel_ helps you to create interactive carousel experience within your Flutter applications.

## Features

_Infinite Carousel_ does not use PageView underneath, therefore it has some unique features not present in PageView based Carousels like:

#### Granular control over selected item placement

It allows you to control placement (or anchor) of selected item on viewport (unlike PageView which always has its selected page in the center of viewport).

#### Fine tuning Scroll Velocity

It gives control over of scrolling speed, therefore allowing user to increase / slow the carousel movements when scrolled free hand.

#### Friction effect

It simulates a realistic slowing down effect after scrolling, adding a touch of natural behavior and refinement.

#### Supports Multiple Scroll Physics

Default behaviour is `InfiniteScrollPhysics`, which makes sure we always land on an item after free hand scrolling, with added friction effect. But you can also set it to `PageViewTypeScrollPhysics` to get the PageView like scroll effect.

#### Infinite looping

It supports infinite looping on items, and exposes both actual indices and relative indices of items.

#### Horizontal and Vertical Axis

It supports both horizontal and vertical axis directions with respect to LTR and RTL text directions.

# Usage

Add the package to `pubspec.yaml`

```bash
$ flutter pub add infinite_carousel
```

or

```yaml
dependencies:
  infinite_carousel: ^1.1.0
```

After that import the package.

```dart
import 'package:infinite_carousel/infinite_carousel.dart';
```

```dart
InfiniteCarousel.builder(
  itemCount: 10,
  itemExtent: 120,
  center: true,
  anchor: 0.0,
  velocityFactor: 0.2,
  onIndexChanged: (index) {},
  controller: controller,
  axisDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  loop: true,
  itemBuilder: (context, itemIndex, realIndex) {
  },
)
```

## Controller

You can programatically control the Carousel movement by providing _`InfiniteScrollController`_, which provides number of useful methods.

- pass `initialItem` in the constructor.
- animateToItem(index)
- jumpToItem(index)
- nextItem()
- previousItem()

If axis is horizontal, then this corresponds to width of item, else height of the item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required                 |
| itemBuilder    | Widget Function(BuildContext, int itemIndex, int realIndex) | To lazily build items on the viewport. When Loop is false, ItemIndex is equal to RealIndex (i.e, index of element). When loop is true, two indexes are exposed by item builder. One is itemIndex, that is the modded item index i.e., for list of 10, position(11) = 1, and position(-1) = 9. Other is realIndex, that is the actual index, i.e. (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...) in loop. Real Index is needed if you want to support JumpToItem by tapping on it. | Required                 |
| physics        | ScrollPhysics                                               | Defaults to `InfiniteScrollPhysics`, which makes sure we always land on a particular item after free-hand scrolling. You can also provide `PageViewTypeScrollPhysics` to get PageView scroll effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | InfiniteScrollPhysics    |

## Flutter web

Earlier, flutter allowed scrolling the widgets by dragging using the mouse. Now, by default, it allows scrolling widgets to be dragged by all PointerDeviceKinds except for PointerDeviceKind.mouse.

If you want to support scrolling by drag, please pass the explicit `ScrollBehavior` to InfiniteCarousel.

```dart
scrollBehavior: ScrollConfiguration.of(context).copyWith(
  dragDevices: {
    // Allows to swipe in web browsers
    PointerDeviceKind.touch,
    PointerDeviceKind.mouse
  },
),
```
